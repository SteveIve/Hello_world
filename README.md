# Hello_world
This is my first time to add a repository in GitHub.
As an English major
and a Chinese guy,
it's a little bit hard to learn programming
In Chinese,
there is a saying:
The boy is chasing a butterfly,
and at the same time,
he wants to climb to the top of the mountain.
Best wish for me.
Good luck.
